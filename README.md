CSE 3310  Intro to Software Engineering- Had to make a final project that was worth 50% of our grade. 
Worked with 3 people to create a short video game demo, and present it to the whole class.
I did the battlesystem part of the assignment. The others had to do the rest. I also implemented run away function which is a 50% chance of running away, as well as some other implementations. 
Had to also create some slides for the project. 
Note: Documents folder is what we had to show to the professor before we began to code our assignment. 
Learned how to use Unity to make a game for an android application
